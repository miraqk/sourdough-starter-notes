title: Reviving the Starter
---

The recommended method for reviving the starter can be found in the King Arthur Flour recipe article “[Putting your sourdough starter on hold](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2015/05/01/putting-sourdough-starter-hold).”

However, there are some tweaks I’d recommend.

1. Use a larger, wide-mouthed mason jar or something similar (I keep mine in a 32-oz jar).
2. The recipe linked uses oz weights, and after step 7, I’d switch over to tablespoons/teaspoons.
3. For the first feeding, I put in 1 tablespoon of unbleached all-purpose flour and about 1 teaspoon of water and mix vigorously. The ending viscosity should be like pudding--not too firm or dry, but not too runny.
4. Following feedings should be about a 1:1 ratio of flour to water—I tend to use 1 ⅓ tablespoons of flour and 1 ½ tablespoons of water.
