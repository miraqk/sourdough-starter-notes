It should be robust enough that it can handle whatever flour you feed it, but its coloration and speckle comes from the flours I used to start it. The proportions are:
- 2 portions unbleached all-purpose wheat flour (from King Arthur)
- 1 portion rice flour (from Bob’s Red Mill)
- 1 portion dark rye flour (from Bob’s Red Mill)

Unless you keep it in warmer temperatures, it’s not a particularly effervescent starter; it’s a bit chill, but don’t worry, it’s still alive and working. It’s more likely you’ll see a lot of smaller bubbles that slowly appear and disappear.
