## [King Arthur Flour Buttery Sourdough Buns](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/buttery-sourdough-buns-recipe)

I go back to this one a lot; it’s super simple, can be done in a day, lets you play with the starter and has packaged yeast to help with the fluff in case the starter’s feeling lazy. It’s also an easy recipe to fiddle with—you can mix garlic salt or crushed garlic in with the melted butter and turn them into garlic rolls; you can put some malted milk powder in with a smidge of molasses instead of sugar to have a richer, sweeter roll, and so on.
